            <p>This conference focuses on the theoretical analysis of discrete models arising from partial differential
                equations (PDEs), a cornerstone of modern computational science. Numerical simulation plays a vital role
                not only in science and engineering, but increasingly in economics, biology, and medicine. At the heart
                of these simulations lies the transformation of continuous models—typically expressed as PDEs—into
                discrete numerical schemes using techniques such as the finite element method (FEM). Theoretical
                justification of such schemes and the development of new mathematical frameworks are critical to
                ensuring reliable, high-quality simulations.</p>
            <p>This conference brings together leading researchers from China and Japan, with a special emphasis on
                early-career scientists. It serves not only as an academic platform to share cutting-edge research, but
                also as a strategic initiative to deepen bilateral collaboration. Through invited talks and poster
                sessions, the conference aims to foster dialogue, inspire future joint research, and build a sustainable
                network for the advancement of numerical analysis.
            </p>

            <p>This conference is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Japan
                Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) under their bilateral collaboration program. </p>
